# documentary.

documentary is a repository of provable public knowledge. It's a DApp that provides an easy and user-friendly way of
publishing documents on the Ethereum blockchain and for searching these documents and retrieving them from the blockchain. 
documentary is free to use, only transactions costs incur and only for publishing documents.
 
documentary consists of a smart contract that lives on the etherum blockchain and a browser-based frontend to interact with 
the smart contract. documentary is fully dezentralized, there is no backend. The frontend is deployed at 
<a href="http://documentary-dapp.io">documentary-dapp.io</a>. The frontend can also be ran locally.
 
This repository contains the full source code of the documentary frontend.
