# documentary.

documentary provides an easy and user-friendly way of publishing documents on the Ethereum blockchain, and for searching the documents and retrieving them from the blockchain. documentary is free to use, only transactions costs incur and only for publishing documents.
 
documentary consists of a smart contract that lives on the Ethereum blockchain and a browser-based frontend to interact with the smart contract. documentary is fully dezentralized, there is no backend. The frontend is deployed at <a href="http://documentary-dapp.io">documentary-dapp.io</a>. The frontend also runs locally.
 
This repository contains the full source code of the documentary smart contract as well as the documentary frontend.
 
 
 Hints on Running documentary Locally
 ---
 To run documemtary locally, just clone the complete repository and open file src/main/webapp/index.html in your web browser. Note that if you are using Metamask, you should not open the file directly from the file system, since this is not supported by Metamask for security reasons. Instead, you need to serve the file via a local webserver, such as XAMPP, for example.
